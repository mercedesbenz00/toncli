## Commands

All commands could be fined in [docs/advanced/commands.md](/docs/advanced/commands.md)

### Configuration

Config folder will create on first deploy, all fift / func libs will copy to it, also deploy wallet contract will be
created

### Deploy process (how it's actually work)

1. Check network (testnet, mainnet) configuration locally (in config user folder)
    1. If no config found - download from URL in config.ini
2. Check deploy wallet locally (in config user folder)
    1. If it's first time - simple wallet will be created in config folder
    2. Message with wallet address and tips will be displayed (user need to send some TON coin on it)
    3. If there is no TON in deploy contract - script will exit and notify user to update deployer balance
3. Will run tests on `fift/data.fif` / `fift/message.fif` (if exist) / `fift/lib.fif` (if exist)  before creating deploy
   message
    1. This will check all files are correct
    2. Also, you can run custom logic - for example create keys in build/
4. Will calculate address of contract and display it to user
5. Will send money from deploy wallet
6. Will deploy your contract
    1. [External message](https://gist.github.com/tvorogme/fdb174ac0740b6a52d1dbdf85f4ddc63#file-generate-fif-L113) will
       be created
    2. Boc will generated
    3. Will invoke sendfile in lite-client (TODO: use native python lib, not lite-client)

## Development

```
git clone git@github.com:disintar/toncli.git
cd toncli && pip install -e .
```

## Version migration

#### 0.24

Please, use `toncli update_libs`

#### 0.22

The easy migration method - remove `fift-libs`, `func-libs` from `~/.config/toncli` or delete whole directory `~/.config/toncli`
