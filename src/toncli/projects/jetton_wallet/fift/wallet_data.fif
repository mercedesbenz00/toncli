 This file is primerely for tests to run
 Main way of deploying jetton wallet is via jetton minter "mint" operation.
 Sending jettons from already deployed wallet is also an option
 Thus random 256 bit value will be used ans and address for collection and owner

 We're going to use newkeypair as a way to generate two random 256 bit values
 Do not do that in real app
