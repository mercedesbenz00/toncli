## How to debug transactions with toncli?

Sometimes when you send your message to network - it's not working like you planned. So what you can do?

First of all - you need to find out 3 constants. Lt (logical_time), transaction hash and smart contract address in which
you send this transaction. Those constants could be found in any ton scaner.

Tncli provides ease to use command:

`!WARNING!` Before running this command you should run `toncli deploy...` once to create wallet config.

`usage: toncli run_transaction [-h] [--net {testnet,mainnet}] [--function FUNCTION] [--save SAVE] logical_time transaction_hash smc_address
`

`--function` is by default `-1` it's runvm function selector, if your transaction is internal you need to use `0`

e.g.

```

This command creates locally configurated VM on time of transaction was made. It's quite easy to get errors from it. As
you see all TVM operations are printed and you can see stack (it's quite needed for transaction debuging).

Also if you want to change `runvm` parameters on your own you can save generated fif file by `--save location` flag:

`toncli run_transaction 8705051000001 0EcnuZxjp5EWxRrOH7IG2nXdXT1UD5Ef+F+4fxhMz/M= EQB36_EfYjFYMV8p_cxSYX61bA0FZ4B65ZNN6L8INY-5gL6w --save test.fif`

Then run `test.fif` by `toncli f run ./test.fif`
