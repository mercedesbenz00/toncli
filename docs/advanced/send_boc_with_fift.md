## How to send BOC with fift?

Answer is - no way. But you can use `toncli` to do it for you.

For example - the basic example of wallet use `wallet.fif` to generate `boc` files, then they will be pushed to network with lite-client.

In `wallet` example you can find `fift/usage.fif` file. This is `wallet.fif` but we added one feature there. 

You can see that last line is `saveboc`. It's needed for saving `boc` file in `build/boc` location (or `/tmp` if you run command not in project root) and then our CLI tool can catch it and send to network.

E.g.:

```toncli fift sendboc ./fift/usage.fif build/contract EQB36_EfYjFYMV8p_cxSYX61bA0FZ4B65ZNN6L8INY-5gL6w 0 0 0.01```

Usage.fif takes some arguments to generate boc file, those are: file_base, wallet, subwallet_id, seqno, ammount. 

Seqno can be founded by get method `seqno`:

```
(base) tvorogme in /tmp/wallet λ toncli get seqno

Seqno is `0` in this example.

If you run `sendboc` command in `wallet` project, and pass all arguments right you will see that boc file will be sent with lite-client. 

E.g.:

```
(base) tvorogme in /tmp/wallet λ toncli fift sendboc ./fift/usage.fif build/contract EQB36_EfYjFYMV8p_cxSYX61bA0FZ4B65ZNN6L8INY-5gL6w 0 0 0.01
